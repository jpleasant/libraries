# Datawrap

Datawrap is a very lightweight wrapper to help with interacting with a database. 
It includes simple reusable methods, and base class for simple mapping. 
This is not an object relational mapper nor is meant to take the place of one.
This library is intendend for those who prefer to work with SQL directly or must work with SQL directly
by the nature of their project.

This is written initally to interact with MySQL, but if desired, can be extended to work with
other databases  (ie SQL SERVER, PostgreSQL, etc)
